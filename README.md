# ABBC-SCM: Adaptive Blockchain-Enabled Bio-Inspired Swarm Coordination Model

##  Research Paper Based Project
This project implements the ABBC-SCM model proposed for secure and adaptive UAV swarm coordination using:

- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Blockchain-based Secure Communication

##  Proposed Architecture
The system integrates:

1. Adaptive Intelligence using RL
2. Bio-Inspired Decision Making (ACO & PSO)
3. Blockchain Authentication Layer
4. Self-Healing & Fault Tolerance Mechanism

##  Implementation Platform
- MATLAB Simulation Environment
- Performance metrics evaluated for:
  - 10 UAVs
  - 100 UAVs

## Performance Metrics
- Throughput
- Link Efficiency
- Mission Completion Time
- Energy Consumption

##  Results
The ABBC-SCM model shows:
- 30–40% reduction in mission failure rate
- Improved link efficiency
- Enhanced scalability
- Increased cyber-attack resilience

##  How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Run:
   ABBC_SCM_UAV_Swarm.m
3. View generated performance graphs
